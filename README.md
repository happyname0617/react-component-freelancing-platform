react component freelancing platform

## What is this about?
- the react component freelancing platform trying to solve those problems. 
1. for the freelancer: there is too much communication overhead cost to complete the small task.
2. for product owner: there is too much risk to give the project to the small company, otherwise it is too expensive and too slow.
3. for agency: client work requests are fluctant, it is risky to hire too many employees.

## Goal
- minimize the communication overhead
- maximize the independant work to speed up the project

## How
- use typing tool for a clear specification (e.g. typescript)
- use zeplin for a visual component desigin specification
- use storybook for a visual acceptance test
- use unit tests for a functional acceptance test
- use personal code review to complete the code quality

## Benefit
### for developer: 
- earn the encryptor currency by developing the individual component
- learn the professional level of the code with free code review

### for agency: 
- hire only small size in-house architects and leverage your project speed by outsoucing the react components

### for project owner:
- super fast
- adjust your project goal whether you want to buy the time or buy the quality
- get explicit expected outcome of the project for each sprint

# User Story
